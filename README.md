by me.what exactly we can do is....
improve informayion
improve security 
improve database
improve connectivity(conectivity means connecting between the tabs and mentining path or file name forsome paths and also creating file 
                      for the tabs and buttons).
we can add some videos people intrested in fitness and have knowledge about the fitness could provide information and suggest videos or
can make videos and upload.
graphic desiners will come in handy they can provide a good logo and a banner.
well for coders its more fun to add anything that will improve because the files uploaded and used is basic its the best way to get started
with webdevelopment.
